This repository contains a Python script for predicting salaries based on candidates' experience, test scores, and interview scores. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to make predictions, offering insights for human resources departments and hiring managers.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn,math
Ensure that your dataset is structured with columns for 'Experience', 'Test Score', 'Interview Score', and 'Salary'.
Prepare your dataset in a compatible format, such as a CSV file, and place it in the same directory as the script.
Modify the script as needed to load your dataset. Update the file path if necessary.
Run the script:salary_prediction.ipynb
The script will generate predictions for the provided dataset and display them.
Data Format
Experience: Number of years of experience (float or integer).
Test Score: Score achieved in a standardized test (float or integer).
Interview Score: Score received in the interview process (float or integer).
Salary: Target variable, the salary to be predicted (float or integer).
Model Training
The model is trained using a supervised learning approach.
Data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and handling missing values may be applied.
Contributors
Contributors are welcome to suggest improvements, bug fixes, or additional features through pull requests.
